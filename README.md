## How to run

There are two elements to this setup... The client and the API. You need to launch both of them inorder to run this in development mode.

To run the client:
```
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

Then to run the api, open another terminal window in the root directory and run:
```
$ cd api
$ node app.js
```

Testing client: test file-by-file. 
```
cd client
jest <file_name>
```
